    <section class="about">
        <p>
            I am a passionate Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a strong interest in coding and problem-solving. Proficient in C and Python, 
            I enjoy tackling challenges through programming and am constantly learning and evolving in the world of technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a deep appreciation for ancient languages and spend time studying Sanskrit, which helps me sharpen my analytical and 
            logical thinking. I’m also an avid chess player, which further hones my strategic mindset and decision-making skills.
        </p>

        <p>
            My ultimate goal is to become a problem solver, not only in technical fields but also in broader social contexts. I am dedicated to developing solutions 
            that can make a positive impact on society and am always looking for opportunities to collaborate with like-minded individuals to address real-world challenges.
